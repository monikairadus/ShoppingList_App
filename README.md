# Shopping List

This application allows you to create a shopping list. You can enter the name of a specific product. After pressing the "Add" button, the given product is saved on the shopping list. In each line of this list, we have tools that allow you to operate a given product. If we already have an item in the shopping basket, we can delete it from the list. We can also edit our data for the list, including specifying a specific quantity of the product and unit. The product can also be removed from the list.
It is also possible to search for products containing a given phrase in their name.
